Welcome to TTL's documentation!
===============================

Tensor & Tiling Library is an open-source header only library to enable the efficient tiling and compute with tensors.

The purpose of this software package is to provide a simple to use standardized way of tiling tensors to allow performance optimization in heterogenous machines. Tiling is one of the pillars of performance and the Tensor Tiling Library is intended to provide a standardized approach.
